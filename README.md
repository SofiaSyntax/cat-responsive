The given task was to make an existing website responsive. 
The website was originally made for desktop view, and I chose to re-make it using mobile first. 
The task also included creating a separate page for a sign-up form, accessible by clicking the button "bli medlem" at the top of the page.
In mobile view the navigation shall include a hamburger (collapsable) menu and added visual effects of our choosing when you hover over buttons and pictures.

Additional requirements apart from being responsive: 

* The form must contain input-fields for:
*  first name
*  last name
*  username
*  password
*  email
*  favourite cat breed
*  checkbox for agreeing to terms
